Clinical trial data to GBD classifier

The use of the classifier needs the installation of MetaMap. IntraMap can not be installed locally. New UMLS concepts not already projected to ICD10 codes during the development of the classifier need to be added to the classifier's database by running IntraMap on the website from Medical Ontology Research project of the NLM (https://mor.nlm.nih.gov/). Both MetaMap and IntraMap request the user to sign to the UMLS license agreement.
